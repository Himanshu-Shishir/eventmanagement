            <h1>Privacy Policy:</h1><br>
            <p>Our Privacy Policy talks about what information we collect and how this affects you. 
            It also explains the steps we take to protect your privacy, like building our Services so delivered messages aren’t 
            stored by us and giving you control over who you communicate with on our Services. 
            The types of information we receive and collect depend on how you use our Services. 
            We require certain information to deliver our Services and without this we will not be able 
            to provide our Services to you. For example, you must provide your mobile phone number to create an 
            account to use our Services. Our Services have optional features which, if used by you, require us to 
            collect additional information to provide such features. You will be notified of such collection, as appropriate. 
            If you choose not to provide the information needed to use a feature, you will be unable to use the feature.</p>

            <h3>Information You Provide</h3>

            <h4>Your Account Information:</h4>  
            <p>You must provide your mobile phone number and basic information 
            (including a profile name of your choice) to create an account. If you don’t provide us with this information, 
            you will not be able to create an account to use our Services. You can add other information to your account, 
            such as a profile picture and "about" information.</p>

            <h4>Transactions And Payments Data:</h4>
            <p>If you use our payments services, or use our Services meant for purchases or 
            other financial transactions, we process additional information about you, including payment account and transaction 
            information. Payment account and transaction information includes information needed to complete the transaction 
            (for example, information about your payment method, shipping details and transaction amount). 
            If you use our payments services available in your country or territory, our privacy practices are described in the 
            applicable payments privacy policy.</p>

            <h4>Customer Support And Other Communications:</h4>
            <p>When you contact us for customer support or otherwise communicate with us, 
            you may provide us with information related to your use of our Services, including copies of your messages, 
            any other information you deem helpful, and how to contact you (e.g., an email address). For example, you may 
            send us an email with information relating to app performance or other issues.</p>

            <h3>How We Use Information</h3>
            <p>We use information we have (subject to choices you make and applicable law) to operate, provide, 
            improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services.</p><b>Here's how:</b>

            <h4>Our Services:</h4>
            <p>We use information we have to operate and provide our Services, including providing 
            customer support; completing purchases or transactions; improving, fixing, and customizing our Services. 
            We also use information we have to understand how people use our Services; evaluate and improve our Services; 
            research, develop, and test new services and features; and conduct troubleshooting activities. 
            We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.</p>

            <h4>Safety, Security, And Integrity:</h4>
            <p>Safety, security, and integrity are an integral part of our Services. 
            We use information we have to verify accounts and activity; combat harmful conduct; protect users against bad 
            experiences and spam; and promote safety, security, and integrity on and off our Services, such as by investigating 
            suspicious activity or violations of our Terms and policies, and to ensure our Services are being used legally.
            </p>
            <h4>Communications About Our Services And The Facebook Companies:</h4>
            <p>We use information we have to communicate with you 
            about our Services and let you know about our terms, policies, and other important updates.</p>

            <h4>No Third-Party Banner Ads:</h4>
            <p>We still do not allow third-party banner ads on our Services. We have no intention to 
            introduce them, but if we ever do, we will update this Privacy Policy.
